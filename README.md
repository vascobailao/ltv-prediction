# LTV

The business model is subscription based. They have different insurance products and we have a wide variety of features available per user, some of which can change over time.

The task is to create a model that predicts the customer lifetime value (aka LTV) of a customer **for the next 12 months.** This metric is the sum of the monthly commission we collect from a customer during the first 12 months since they join us, plus the one time commission from additional products they might purchase (cross sell). The customers can cancel their subscription at any time.
